# Hotel Booking Final Project

## Dataset Overview
The `hotel_bookings.csv` dataset offers a comprehensive look into the intricacies of hotel booking records, detailing booking status, customer information, the duration of stays, and various financial details.

## Data Analytics Goal
The primary objective is to enable an Online Travel Agency (OTA) to enhance revenue streams for its lodging partners by strategically modifying the average daily rate (ADR).

### Analytics Insight
- **Macro Analysis**: Investigating the influence of hotel booking attributes on the ADR.
- **Micro Analysis**: Assessing how the number of guests, available facilities, choice of month/season, and the timing of promotions affect the ADR.

### Business Impact
- **Expected Outcome**: Determine the impact of different attributes on the ADR and formulate strategies to enhance it.
- **Benefits**: Empower OTAs and lodging partners to strategically adjust prices and design marketing promotions effectively.

## Machine Learning Application

### Context
The OTA utilizes historical booking data to predict the likelihood of cancellations, aiding lodging partners in implementing a double booking strategy to mitigate potential revenue losses.

### Problem Statement
- **Challenge**: How can OTAs detect bookings with a high risk of cancellation?
- **Goal**: Precisely identify bookings at risk to permit double booking opportunities, thereby minimizing revenue loss.

### Metric Evaluation
- **Precision**: Essential for the accuracy of cancellation predictions.
- **Recall**: Critical for identifying all potential cancellations.
- **F1 Score**: Balances precision and recall, optimizing model performance.

### Project Limitations
- **Risks**: Inaccuracies arising from unexpected events or incomplete data.
- **Considerations**: A double booking strategy must be carefully managed to avoid operational and reputational costs.

## Conclusion and Recommendations
This project aims to leverage data analytics and machine learning to enhance revenue for OTA's lodging partners. The use of predictive modeling for cancellation risks, alongside strategic ADR adjustments, could significantly improve profitability. Continuous evaluation and refinement of these strategies are recommended to maintain their effectiveness over time.
